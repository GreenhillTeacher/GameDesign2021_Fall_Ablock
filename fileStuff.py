#  write ('w')
#  read('r')
#  append('a')
#  close()

#To create a file you must declare a variable name so we can open the file
# this is the way to open and create a file
# myFile=open('score.txt', 'w')
# myFile.write("Hello there, \n My name is Maria \t 1224")
# myFile.close()# Always close your file as soon as you dont need it anymore
# #this is the way to open and read a file
# myFile=open('score.txt', 'r')
# print(myFile.read())
# myFile.close()
# #Write things on the file, 'w' will delete what is on the file and write over it
# anotherFile=open('score.txt', 'w')
# anotherFile.write("Sorry, I changed my mind")

# #reprint
# myFile=open('score.txt', 'r')

# #append
